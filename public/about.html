        <h1> About the project </h1>
        <h2>The vision</h2>
        <p>The vision of the project was to build a platform for an ephemeral Location Based Service (LBS).</br>
        This platform is intended to be used for a use case of sharing experiences. It should provide a peer-to-peer communication in a defined location area. </p>
        <h2>The project</h2>
        <p> The project consists of two parts. One the one hand the public website you are visiting here and on the other hand a mobile android application for your smartphone. 
            The application provides the functionality of the peer-to-peer communication. That means the user has the possibility to share messages with peers around him. 
            The mobile application:  When using the application the user at first has to authentificate himself if he wants to get access to all functionalities of the application. The main functionalities are
            sharing messages with and receiving them from other app-users.  Sharing messages is only possible in specified areas, called zones. When starting the application it lists all zones
            around the user, who has to join one of them. The user then is able to enter one zone and receives all messages that where shared there before. From now on he is also able to send messages to peers in 
            the zone. Messages are shared, when the phones are in a certain distance to each other. When leaving the zone, the shared messages of the user are pushed to a server and are now available for users, who
            will enter the zone afterwards. The application also offers the functionality to create new zones.
            The public website: The website visualizes the zones that were created in the application in a map and also offers the functionality to create new ones. It shows the shared messages within the zones besides
            the man and moreover, the user is able to explore statistics about the activities in the different zones.</p>
            
        <h3>The zones</h3>
        <p> A zone is a specified area for the peer-to-peer communication. Each message is related to one zone. On the website the user can create new zones and can define their duration.</p>
        
        <h3>Sharing experiences</h3>
        <p> The website offers the oppurtunity to access the messages that were shared in the zones. Creating new messages is only available in the mobile application.</p>
           
        <h3>Exploring statistics</h3>
        <p> Statistics show the activity for each existing zone. The user can see how much message were shared when in the chosen zone. For further help see the help page.</p>
      
        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>The project was realized at the Institute of Geoinformatics (ifgi) at the University of Münster under the supervision of Prof. Christian Kray. Participants of the project team were: </br>
        Marlena Götza, Clemens Hackenberg, Milan Köster, Heinrich Löwen, Clara Rendel, Boris Stöcker, Jan van Zadelhoff, Saad Sarfraz, Salman Khalid, Shahzeib Tariq Jaswal, Sruthi Ketineni,
         Apurva Nil Kochar, Jun Xiang
