        <h1> About the project </h1>
        <h2>The vision</h2>
        <p>The vision of the project was to build a platform for an ephemeral Location Based Service (LBS).</br>
        This platform is intended to be used for a use case of sharing experiences. It provides a peer-to-peer communication in a defined location area. </p>
        <h2>The project</h2>
        <p> The overall project is divided into two parts. One the one hand, there is this public website. On the other hand, there is a mobile application that is running on android smartphones. 
            The application provides the functionality of a peer-to-peer communication. That means the user has the possibility to create and share messages to arbitrary with peers around him.
            The mobile application: When using the application the user at first has to authentificate himself if he wants to get access to all functionalities of the application. The main functionalities are
            sharing messages with and receiving them from other app-users. Sharing messages is only possible in specified areas, called zones. When starting the application it lists all zones
            around the user, who has to join one of them. The user then is able to enter one zone and receives all messages that where shared there before. From now the user is also able to send messages to peers in
            the zone. Messages are shared, when the phones are in a certain distance to each other. When leaving the zone, the shared messages of the user are pushed to a server and are now available for users, who
            will enter the zone afterwards. The application also offers the functionality to create new zones.
            The public website: The website offers the possibility to create new zones,view the shared messages in each one and explore statistics about the zone. Moreover, the user can search for zones and
            explore them from everywhere. The website visualizes the zones in an interactive map and provides help to the user for using it.</p>

        <h3>The zones</h3>
        <p> A zone is a specified area for the peer-to-peer communication. Each message is related to one zone. On the website the user can create new zones and has to define their duration and topics.</p>

        <h3>Sharing experiences</h3>
        <p> The website offers the oppurtunity to access the messages that were shared in the zones. Creating new messages is only available in the mobile application.</p>

        <h3>Exploring statistics</h3>
        <p> Statistics show the activity for each existing zone. The user can see how much message were shared in the chosen zone. For further help see the <a href="help.html">Help </a> page.</p>

        <h3>Searching</h3>
        <p>With the searching functionality, the user can search for zone names and select zones to get more information in which he is interested in.</p>

        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>The project was realized at the Institute of Geoinformatics (ifgi) at the University of Münster under the supervision of Prof. Christian Kray during the summerterm 2016. </br>
        The participants of the project team were: </br>
        Marlena Götza, Clemens Hackenberg, Milan Köster, Boris Stöcker, Jan van Zadelhoff, Salman Khalid, Saad Sarfraz, Heinrich Löwen, Clara Rendel, Shahzeib Tariq Jaswal, Sruthi Ketineni,
         Apurva Nil Kochar, Maurin Radtke
