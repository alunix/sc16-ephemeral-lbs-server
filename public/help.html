        <h1>Welcome to the help page! </h1>
        <h3>Here you will get some help and hints for using the website!</h3>
        <p>The website offers you several possibilities to explore activities in your city. Where is the best party? Where is the cheapest place to eat or where are the nicest places in the city?
            On the left side you can see a map with all existing zones. One the right side you will later see the messages, statistics or set options for your own zone. 
            To start you can either choose an existing zone in the map, search for a zone in the search bar  or create a new zone.</p>
            <img src="images/start.jpg" height="200" >
        <h2>Searching zones</h2>
        <p>To find a zone you can use the search functionality. You can search for a zone with its name. The search also provides a list with all existing zones.
        <img src="images/search.jpg" height="50"> </br>
        <h2>Accessing messages</h2>
        <p>To access the messages that were shared within a zone, you have to click on the zone. I there are overlapping zones you have to choose one from the appearing popup. After choosing one the messages are displayed 
            in the message window on the right side. They are ordered from the newest to the oldest message.</p> 
            <img src="images/messages.jpg" height="200"> </br>
        <h2>Creating zones</h2>
        <p> For creating a zone you have to use the <button id="toggleeditbtn" type="button" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" >Add new zone</button> button. After you have clicked on it the button will disappear 
            and the edit modus opens.</p>
            <img src="images/addzone.jpg" height="200"> </br>
           <p> Now you can draw your zone directly on the map and set its properties afterwards. It is mandatory to set a name, a duration until when the zone should exists 
            and at least one topic for the zone. The duration can be defined with the poping up calender. In the calender you can choose a date and a time until when the zone should exist. </p>
             <img src="images/datepicker.jpg" height="150" > </br>
        <p> The coordinates are inserted automatically after drawing the zone. With the <button class="btn btn-success btn-xs">Submit</button> button you can finish the zone. 
            There is also the possibility to reset the entries or to cancel the zone creation.</p>
        <h2>Exploring statistics</h2>
        <p> The website offers statistics that show the activity in each zone. For exploring the statistics you have to choose a zone in the map, the statistic will then be generated automatically.</p>
